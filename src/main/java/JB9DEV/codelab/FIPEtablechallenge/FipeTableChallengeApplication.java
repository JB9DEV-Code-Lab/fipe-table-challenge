			* [X] call presenter introduction, to give a small introduction about the application

					[X] call filter to get only the brands with the same first letter
					[X] call presenter to list them
				if there is no brand with the same first letter
					[X] call presenter to show all brands
				if there is
					[X] call presenter to show them
					[X] call reader to ask if one of them should be the one or if the person wants to list all of them
					[X] if that is the case, call reader to ask which branch the person wants to search for
			* [xÂ±] call reader to ask which of the models the person wants to search for

				* [X] desirialize from DTO
				* [ ] serialize to DTO
			* 	presenters to handle what should be asked and printed

				* 	[x] introduction
				* 	[x] brand
				* 	[x] model
				* 	[ ] vehicle
				* [x] should have a public method to show what should be presented in each step and the presenter knows
